# EndoNet-Compilation
EndoNet have an information of the endocrine system in human. It is inter-cellular network. It includes information about hormones, receptors and cells, furthermore it has relation like binding of a hormone to receptor, transportation medium etc. Main thing is this whole data manually annotated from scientific literature. Web version of this dataset can be found at  http://endonet.sybig.de/
We have extract gene-gene relation out of inter-cellular network. which will be at final_resolve_3 file.

Repository 1) Codes:
              This repository contains all tag extraction file in order to create final dataset. files are resolution of secretion, receptor, hormone, cell, influence etc. elements of EndoNet. Information about those elements can be found here http://endonet.sybig.de/. We have also include uniprot to official gene symbol.
           2) Dataset:
              This repository contains all extraction information of variaus elements mentioned in Codes section. final compiled file named as final_resolve_3.csv that contains secretion hormone cell name and id, secretion hormone id and name, associate gene uniprot, ensembl ,official gene name(HGNC) to receptor hormone cell name and id,  receptor id and name, associate gene uniprot, ensembl ,official gene name(HGNC).
